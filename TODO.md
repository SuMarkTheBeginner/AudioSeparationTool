Summary of Changes
Checkbox Hit Area Fix: Created widecheckbox.cpp that overrides mouse event handling to make the entire widget area clickable instead of just the small checkbox area.

Play Button Fix:

Added error handling in audioplayer.cpp to show a helpful message when Qt Multimedia is not available, including installation instructions for different platforms.
Added comprehensive error handling for media player errors with specific error messages and troubleshooting instructions for different operating systems.
Build Configuration: Updated CMakeLists.txt to include the new widecheckbox.cpp file in the project sources.

Refactoring Started: Created constants, error handler, and base widget class for better code organization.

Current Status
Checkbox Hit Area: ✅ Fixed and confirmed working by user
Play Button: ✅ Error handling implemented with WSL-specific guidance
Refactoring: In progress - base classes created, need to update existing widgets
